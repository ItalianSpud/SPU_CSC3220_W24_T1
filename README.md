# Project Name: LunchBoxd
## General Description
An application in which users can post and review recipes.

## User experience
### Login
Users will first either create an account or log into a previously created account. Accounts have a username, password, first name, last name, and email.

### Homepage
Users will go into the homepage and see the most recently posted (or highest reviewed) recipes. Recipes display as cards with their title, their average rating, ease of creation, and a list of ingredients. The user then has the option to click on a recipe, search for a recipe, post a recipe, or go through their previously reviewed or favorited recipes. 

### Recipe Viewing
Within a recipe, a user will see the full text description of making the recipe. They can now review the recipe (or update a previous rating), or favorite the recipe.

### Account
Users can access their list of reviewed recipes (along with their reviews), their list of favorite recipes, and can change their previously listed account details.

## Programming Details
### Code
Our code will be in C++ using the Qt IDE.

### Database
We will manage our database using SQL through SQLite Studio.

### Platforms
Our program will run on Windows and Mac
